# Unified UI component APIs for Compose Multiplatform

## Material Design

Compose Multiplatform Material Design component wrappers are added for Desktop, Android (both based on the `androidx.compose.material` package), and Web (mainly based on [KMDC](https://github.com/mpetuska/kmdc))

## iOS

Support for iOS is TBD due to no mature working Compose wrappers.
