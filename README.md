# Compose Multiplatform Material wrappers

Compose Multiplatform Material Design component wrappers for Desktop, Android, and Web (mainly based on [KMDC](https://github.com/mpetuska/kmdc))

We try to make sure the styles of the `Composable` components follow those in `com.huanshankeji.compose.material`, with, however, only a subset of the `Composable` arguments supported due to the API differences and limitations of the JS components this project depends on.
